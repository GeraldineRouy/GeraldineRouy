[MatchUp - Single Page Application in Vue.js](https://github.com/GeraldineRouy/match_up)

<strong>A simple Gaming Tournament Tree Generator.</strong>

Imagine you're chilling on the sofa with your friends, and you want to play a competitive game together. Ok, it's just for fun, but, you want to prove every one you're the best, obviously !
So you set up a tournament together... But how to decide who is playing who, how many rounds, how many matches..?
Good news !!! You just have to browse mathcUp, enter everyone's name, and VOILA !

Start a new tournament and have fun !


[Minecraft Plugin Template(Spigot/Java Edition)](https://github.com/GeraldineRouy/spigot_plugin_template/tree/master)

I am currently working on a collaborative project : a template for bootstrapping plugins for Minecraft Java Edition, specifically based on a Spigot server.

To streamline development, I am providing a Docker microservice to simplify server deployment, as well as the deployment of plugins derived from it. This aims to make the entire process more efficient and accessible for plugin developers.

The project structure is designed to follow the latest best practices in Java development, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and ease of use for anyone looking to create custom Minecraft plugins using Spigot.
